# auto-react-discord

A simple Discord selfbot made for education purposes that simply reacts to messages if they already have a reaction via HTTP packets.

This is done via the User API, which is, well, meant for users lol.

Please note that this is made for educational purposes, and that Discord is strictly against self bots, and is known to ban accounts using them without warning. Basically, if you use this, there's a chance that you'll get banned by Discord.
