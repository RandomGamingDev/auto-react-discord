# auto-react-discord

A simple Discord selfbot made for education purposes that simply reacts to messages if they already have a reaction via HTTP packets.

This is done via the User API, which is, well, meant for users lol.

To use this script
add your authorization key for your account in the variable which you can copy from the header of discord packets under "Authorization",
then add the channel you want to do this in by putting your channel ID, which you get by going into developer mode and copying and pasting the channel ID.
After getting this data just put the authorization key in the authorization variable, and put the channel ID in the channel variable

Run the script with NodeJS

Please note that this is made for educational purposes, and that Discord is strictly against self bots, and is known to ban accounts using them without warning. Basically, if you use this, there's a chance that you'll get banned by Discord.
